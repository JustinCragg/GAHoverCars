# GAHoverCars
After starting some research into machine learning, I wanted to have a go at putting what I had learnt into action. My project was just a simple demonstration of genetic learning. Each capsule is a hover car which detects walls on either side and front. Each generation changes the distance and strength of reactions towards each wall it detects.
